# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## Project Context
- Data Science and Machine Learning project in Python
- Focus on building reusable ML pipeline components
- Practice-oriented project for learning

## Core Focus Areas
1. Data Preprocessing & Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Classification Model Development (Random Forest)
4. Model Deployment Preparation

## Code Style Guidelines
- Write clean, readable, and well-documented Python code
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Include docstrings for all functions and classes
- Use type hints where applicable
- Add inline comments only for complex logic

## Expected Components
- Utility functions for data cleaning and preprocessing
- EDA visualization templates
- Model training pipeline
- Hyperparameter tuning functions
- Model evaluation metrics
- Model serialization and export

## Code Structure
- Modular design with separate files for each component
- Clear function and variable naming
- Error handling and input validation
- Logging implementation
- Configuration management

## Documentation Requirements
- Function/class purpose and parameters
- Usage examples in docstrings
- Dependencies and requirements
- Return values and types
- Performance considerations

## Best Practices
- Use pandas for data manipulation
- Implement scikit-learn pipelines
- Follow ML ops best practices
- Create reusable components
- Include unit tests when possible
